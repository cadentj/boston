                    Selecting your home is the fun part! Walk-through different houses with your real estate agent, take notes of which you like, what you like, etc. It may be helpful to make a pros and cons list (or equivalent) so you can later discuss and compare everything you have looked at with ease. Once you have looked through and found your home it is time to put in an offer which you have discussed with your agent. At this point the seller can agree or provide you with a counter-offer— you can of course, agree to that or deny and then continue looking.

                    Before submitting an offer, it is important to take another look at your budget factoring in all closing costs: any repairs that need to be done? what do commuting costs look like? general utility costs? This is important so that when you are walking into your new home you are not ambushed by any surprise expenses you did not realize before. Additionally, keep in mind costs of home inspections, home insurance, property taxes, and if applicable any Homeowner Association (HOA) fees.

                    Once you and the seller agree, you will make a deposit and the home will be in escrow— meaning you are contractually expected to buy the house under the assumption there are no serious damages to the home you were unaware of (NOT costs you did not account for). Typically the lender you use will have a closing attorney, but you are free to hire your own as well.

                    At this time, you may want to discuss with the BHA about hiring an attorney to draw up an agreement prior to accepting the offer. This is to provide you with additional security related to price, closing date, pre-approval letter and overall reviewing the contract for your new home!

                    Now that you have accepted an offer, it is time to also go back to your lender with additional documents to have your mortgage finalized. These documents include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contract to purchase: the signed purchase and sale agreement. If there is any seller credit for closing costs, this must be included</li>
                    <li>Verification of employment (if requested)</li>
                    <li>Rental History: This is to prove you have a history of paying on time</li>
                    <li>Proof of Down payment and Closing Funds</li>
                    <li>Any other documents that may explain exigent circumstances</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    During this stage, your lender or loan specialist will let you know when you are ready to buy homeowner’s insurance. Make sure you are able to afford this because if not, the lender will force insurance on your home which will be MORE expensive. Additionally, keep in mind your lender may require you to pay 10-20% of your annual home insurance premium upfront so it is crucial to have some additional funds set aside for this.
