                    There could be a lot of financial programs you qualify for! These include down payment assistance programs, grants, etc. As long as you are working with one of the lenders on the BHC pre-approved list, you have already met one of the criteria to qualify! We recommend discussing your options with your lender as well as someone from the BHC staff.

                    Once you have gotten pre-approved, it is FINALLY time to start looking for your new home! You can begin looking on Zillow or other homebuying databases, as well as looking at all the recommendations your already found realtor has been sending you! Remember if you have not already to relay information like the following to your realtor:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your budget (You may have changed this after your discussion with the lender and understanding what type of mortgage you were pre-approved for)</li>
                    <li>Your must-haves, wants, and needs</li>
                    <li>Specify locations! (You can never change this aspect of your home so make sure it is perfect)</li>
                    <li>Pick a home!</li>
                </ol>

                    Once you've established your budget and <em>obtained your credit report</em>, it's time to embark on the search for a mortgage lender. It's crucial to undertake this step after completing the entire preparation phase, as it allows you to determine a comfortable down payment amount and understand the amount of money per mortgage payment you can afford. Selecting the right lender is important, and verifying their licensing is essential.
