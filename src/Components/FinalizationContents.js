                    There are two official things left to do:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Get your home appraised as well to double check the loan is accurate to the value of the home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And, even if your home looks perfect, it is crucial to have the home inspected. This will make sure that the home is in fact flawless and there is no serious or structural damage that was not disclosed to you. A home inspection generally includes: roof, visible insulation, HVAC, interior plumbing and electrical systems, attic, windows and doors, foundation, walls, floors, and ceilings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is certain damage that was not disclosed you are able to rescind your offer and get the deposit back or work with the seller to make repairs or discount the price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is none, well you are all set, your home is ALMOST yours!
                </p>
                <p>
                    An appraiser generally looks at: comparable sales, square footage, appearance, amenities, and overall condition.

                    This is a document you will sign that will officially make the house yours! Along with an appraisal and inspection, it is almost important to make sure the seller actually owns the house. Your real estate attorney should conduct a title search to clarify that this is actually true. Typically, the lender’s attorney will handle this as well as any title insurance that needs to be placed on your home.

                    Almost there!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other documents you should have been asked to sign include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Settlement statement: summarizes all final charges and fees</li>
                    <li>The promissory note: legal note showcasing a summary of all payments, when they should be paid, and where they should be sent</li>
                    <li>Deed of mortgage or trust: The document in which you sign a lien (security deposit of sorts) as security for repayment of your loan</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is where you will also pay all closing costs, so make sure you have enough funds to be able to cover those by this meeting… Congratulations!!
